# TargetSum - A React Native Game
This project is a game that challenges players to quickly calculate the sum of random numbers. Built using React Native, this project involved generating and manipulating random data, utilizing lifecycle methods to manage the game state, and implementing a timer to increase the level of difficulty.

To ensure optimal performance and a seamless user experience, caching was used to store computable values and component remounting was implemented to reset the game. Through this project, I honed my skills in React Native, lifecycle management, and performance optimization, gaining valuable insights into creating engaging and user-friendly applications.

## Features
- Fun and addictive gameplay
- Random number generation
- Timer to add an element of difficulty
